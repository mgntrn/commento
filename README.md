You're viewing the GitHub mirror of the `master` branch. All development, however, [takes place on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/commento/commento-ce), not on this repo. Please submit all issues and patches over there. If you're looking for the older, deprecated version, see the [`v0` branch](https://github.com/adtac/commento/tree/v0).

Commento is a discussion platform that you can embed on your blog, news articles, and any place where you want your readers to add comments. Commento is fast, lightweight, and privacy-focused; we'll never sell your data, show ads, embed third-party tracking scripts, or inject affiliate links.

#### Features

 - Privacy-focused
 - Super lightweight, allowing for fast pageloads
 - Automatic spam filtering
 - Review and approve or delete comments through the moderation interface
 - Modern interface with a clean design
 - OAuth support (Google login, for example)
 - Custom CSS theming
 - Import from existing services (like Disqus)
 - Completely free and open source (MIT Expat license)

#### Editions

There are three editions of Commento.

 - **Commento Community Edition (CE)** is open source software that's freely available under the MIT license.
 - [**Commento Enterprise Edition (EE)**](https://commento.io/pricing#self-hosted) includes extra features geared towards organizations that want to self-host.
 - [**Commento Hosted**](https://commento.io) is a hosted version of Commento for those who don't want to host and manage servers. This is currently in private beta and you can [add yourself to the waiting list here](https://commento.io).

#### Installation and Configuration

See our [documentation on how to install Commento](http://docs.commento.io/installation.html) to get started. We offer several ways to install the software, including a Docker image.

Once you've installed the software, you need to configure it with various environment variables before starting the service. To learn more about this, refer to our documentation on [configuring Commento](https://docs.commento.io/configuration.html).

#### Contributing

Commento is possible only because of its community. If this is your first contribution to Commento, please go through the [development documentation](https://docs.commento.io/contributing.html) before you begin.

Help will always be given to those who ask for it. We use IRC for chat to collaborate with other developers. You're invited to [hang out with us](https://irc.commento.io) in the `#commento-dev` channel on freenode if you want to contribute to Commento!
